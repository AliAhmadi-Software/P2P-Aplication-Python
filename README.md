# A-P2P-application-with-Python

## Key Discussion Points:
Understand how this new network works:
-What was the problem?
-Types of P2P networks
-Centralized vs. Decentralized model
-How to implement the code
-Provide solutions for network congestion time

## Problem:
We intend to design a network in which each user is all our customers and server. This grid is to be used to multiply large matrices.

## Decentralized:
This architecture has more limitations than centralized architecture. In this architecture, there is no server to manage peers, and each peer with the information it has from a limited part of the network and its neighboring peers can exchange information with those parts.
The most important issue in this architecture is its more limited resources compared to other models.

## Centralized:
In a P2P network with a centralized architecture, the main server stores the information of each peer in a table. This architecture is very similar to the client-server architecture, but with the difference that each peer can independently communicate with the list of other peers, it receives from the main server and exchange information with each other. It should be noted that this architecture is very scalable and the main server is responsible for managing peers and the number of threads created on each peer.
